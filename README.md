# Examples of Applications that employ Apache Brooklyn to Manage Services

Projects in this repository make use of the [Service Broker](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/brooklyn-service-broker) and [CLI plugin](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/brooklyn-plugin) for [Apache Brooklyn](https://brooklyn.incubator.apache.org/).
